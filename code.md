A short list of selected software and mathematical formalisations I have worked
on:

- [`pointfree-topology-in-UF`][1]. Formalisation of some locale theory and
  formal topology in cubical type theory, originally developed to accompany my
  MSc thesis.
- [Sierpiński frame in UF][2]. An implementation of the Sierpiński frame
  using formal topology.
- [Initial frame in `TypeTopology`][3]. Formalisation of the initial frame in
  the [`TypeTopology`][4] library of
- [`sequents`][5]. A *Standard ML* implementation of Roy Dyckhoff's sequent
  calculus [LJT][6].
- [`simplc`][7]. A toy compiler from a simple security-typed imperative
  language into a stack machine, formally verified to preserve the
  noninterference property of the high level language through compilation.
  Developed together with Alexander Fuhs as the final project for [Andrei
  Sabelfeld][8]'s language-based security course at Chalmers.
