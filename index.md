## About

<img src="/~axt978/assets/images/maki-de-madagascar.jpg" alt="Maki de Madagascar"/>

I am PhD student in the [Theory of Computation][1] group at the University of
Birmingham, interested in domain theory and pointfree topology. My supervisor is
[Martín H. Escardó][2] and second supervisor is [Vincent Rahli][3].

Before I started my PhD, I obtained an MSc degree from Chalmers University of
Technology. For my MSc thesis there, I investigated [formal topology][4] in the
context of univalent type theory, under the supervision of [Thierry Coquand][5].

## Research

Most of my work so far has been focussed on making _predicative_ sense of
constructive pointfree topology in the constructive and predicative context of
[Cubical Type Theory][13]. More broadly, my primary research interest is the
connection [between topology and computation][12]. Domains and topology are an
indispensable tool for approaching this connection, but I am interested in other
such tools such as [synthetic topology][10].
