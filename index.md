## About

<img src="/~axt978/assets/images/maki-de-madagascar.jpg" alt="Maki de Madagascar"/>

I am a PhD student in the [Theory of Computation][1] group at the University of
Birmingham, interested in the topological interpretation of computation. My
supervisor is [Martín H. Escardó][2] and second supervisor is [Vincent
Rahli][3].

Before I started my PhD, I obtained an MSc degree from Chalmers University of
Technology where I investigated [formal topology][4] in the context of univalent
type theory for my MSc thesis, under the supervision of [Thierry Coquand][5].

## Research

Broadly, I am interested in the connection [between topology and
computation][12]. This connection is most clearly visible through a constructive
and predicative approach to topology, which is why most of my work so far has
been focused on implementing pointfree topology in the constructive and
predicative context of cubical type theory. However, I am interested in other
ways of understanding this connection such as [synthetic topology][10].
